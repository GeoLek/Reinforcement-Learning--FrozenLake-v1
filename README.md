# Reinforcement-Learning - FrozenLake-v1
A repo to show how to train an agent on the FrozenLake-v1 environment using the Deep Q-network (DQN) and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms. We trained the agent both locally and we created a RESTful API to interact with the FrozenLake environment and evaluate the trained agents.
